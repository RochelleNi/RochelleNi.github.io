Enrolled at the age of 16, I am currently a freshman undergrad majoring in Artificial Intelligence at Yuanpei College, Peking University. My academic journey is guided by Prof. Shanghang Zhang, while I am also fortunate to be a member of the Tong Class (an elite undergraduate program in Artificial Intelligence led by Prof. Song-Chun Zhu).
